hoary->breezy
-------------
- stop gnome-volume-manager before the hoary->breezy upgrade
  (it will crash otherwise)
- send a "\n" on the libc6 question on hoary->breezy

general
-------
- CDROM upgrades !!!
- display a message that all applications should be closed for the 
  dist-upgrade (and that strange things like a crashing panel can
  happen)

- whitelist removal (pattern? e.g. c102 -> c2a etc)?
- logging for the dpkg install run

- check authentication and don't upgrade anything that is not
  authenticated (maybe just comment unauthenticated stuff out?)
