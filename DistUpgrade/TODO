- CDROM upgrades !!!
- display a message that all applications should be closed for the 
  dist-upgrade (and that strange things like a crashing panel can
  happen)
- stop gnome-volume-manager before the hoary->breezy upgrade
  (it will crash otherwise)
- check authentication and don't upgrade anything that is not
  authenticated (maybe just comment unauthenticated stuff out?)
- restore sources.list if anything goes wrong before doing the actual
  upgrade (e.g. dependency calculation)
- whitelist removal (pattern? e.g. c102 -> c2a etc)?
- logging for the dpkg install run
