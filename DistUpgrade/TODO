hoary->breezy
-------------
- stop gnome-volume-manager before the hoary->breezy upgrade
  (it will crash otherwise)
- send a "\n" on the libc6 question on hoary->breezy

general
-------
- CDROM upgrades !!!
- display a message that all applications should be closed for the 
  dist-upgrade (and that strange things like a crashing panel can
  happen)

- whitelist removal (pattern? e.g. c102 -> c2a etc)?
- logging for the dpkg install run

- check authentication and don't upgrade anything that is not
  authenticated (maybe just comment unauthenticated stuff out?)


Robustness:
-----------
- automatically comment out entires in the sources.list that fail to 
  fetch. 
  Trouble: apt doesn't provide a method to map from a line in th
  sources.list to the indexFile and python-apt dosn't proivde a way to
  get all the metaIndexes in sources.list, nor a way to get the
  pkgIndexFiles from the metaIndexes (metaIndex is not available in 
  python-apt at all)
  What we could do is to write DistUpgradeCache.update(), check the
  DescURI for each failed item and guess from it what sources.list
  line failed (e.g. uri.endswith("Sources{.bz2|.gz") -> deb-src, get
  base-uri, find 'dists' in uri etc)
